When a program is licensed under the GNU General Public License (the GPL):

You have the right to use the program for any purpose.
You have the right to modify the program and have access to the source codes.
You have the right to copy and distribute the program.
You have the right to improve the program, and release your own versions.

In return for these rights, you have some responsibilities if you distribute a GPL’d program. These responsibilities are designed to protect your freedoms and the freedoms of others:

You must provide a copy of the GPL with the program, so that recipients are aware of their rights under the license.
You must include the source code or make the source code freely available.
If you modify the code and distribute the modified version, you must license your modifications available under the GPL (or a compatible license).
You may not restrict the licensing of the program beyond the terms of the GPL (you may not turn a GPL’d program into a proprietary product).
